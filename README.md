# Chess

I'm making my own chess web app as a project to give me foundational understanding for future projects that would implement my own ideas for chess variants. First I would make a multiplayer mode, so I can learn about sockets. Then, add a user vs. computer mode, because the future project would be a single player, story-based game.
