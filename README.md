# Chess

I'm making my own chess web app as a project to give me foundational understanding for future projects that would implement my own ideas for chess variants. First I would make a multiplayer mode, so I can learn about sockets. Then, add a user vs. computer mode, because the future project would be a single player, story-based game.

Credit to @judgegodwins for [this guide](https://blog.openreplay.com/building-a-chess-game-with-react/) to get started rendering the chessboard, handling moves, and connecting players.
